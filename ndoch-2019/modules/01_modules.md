## Section 1 - Notebook, Python and Modules

## Open-Source Software (OSS)

Notebook and Python are [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) tools, meaning that they are developed and maintained open instead of closed-source software which is closed to outside development (e.g. Oracle, Apple, Adobe, etc.).

Although opinions abound about which is better, it seems intuitive that a software project would be more robust having more pairs of eyes on it (community) instead of one focused team of developers (closed-source). Many large tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft recognize this trend so have adopted a [hybrid approach](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-open-source-software/) of basing their products on open-source software.

That said, Notebook and Python are open for public code contributions (with approval by core development team) and have an entire ecosystem of open-source libraries available for use within this notebook via Python Modules.
